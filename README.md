# Open5gs deployment automation on VirtualBox
The project aims to automate the deployment of virtual machines
to run Open5gs that simulates 5G core network, and UERANSIM which simulates the radio part.
Current status: Installation scripts implemented, transfer to remote machine implemented

Next objective:
- ~~Configuration file editing with PyYAML~~
- Perform semi-automated setup of simple simulation scenarios

## Status
Work in progress.
